# Portfolio-Optimization
This code is for the 2018 OR & Analytics Student Team Competition.
I realized a portfolio optimization framework which employs an evolutionary algorithm to solve multi-objective mean-variance model and can can preprocess historical data and output optimized portfolio automatically. 

If you want to run this code, make sure your data is in the certain format.
